These are both written content and visual content.

## Quality Content Creation

Creating quality content is very demanding, whether it is for your private blog or your company blog. It will take time to approximate the perfect one of your own.

First, you must think and shape your thoughts in a multi-plane world. Also, the consumers of your blog content are humans. Thus, being clear and concise is a must for your audience. Thus, readability becomes an important aspect along with readability tools.

Second, you must optimize your content for search engines. Otherwise, waiting for people to come and read your content will not be rational behavior.

Third, the visual part of your content is also a factor. For instance, typography or decorative elements also influence your content.

Developing high-quality content is difficult, as it is seen. Therefore, choosing the right _content marketing tool_ is essential for every creator.

### The benefits of creating good content

Content marketing is still one of the most important digital marketing tools. One of the main reasons for this is that the return of investment (ROI) is relatively high.

- It grows your blog audience.
- It acts as a bridge between your company and your prospects.
- In-depth content builds your online reputation in your niche.
- Good content can generate years of organic traffic to your site.

In other words, having high Google rankings for specific keywords gives you a chance to deliver your message to other people for free. Although it is not entirely free, you provide this gain with relatively much fewer costs.


<br/>

### Why use content creation tools?

Content creation tools basically decreases the time you spent while creating your content. In general, they can boost your productivity, your creativity and the quality of your content.

Content creation is at the heart of the evolution of any website. Whether you’re a blogger, journalist, marketer, or creative writer, publishing great content is half the battle.

If your ideas aren’t supported by great visuals and a knack for storytelling, they aren’t much good to anyone. Therefore, handy tools for content creation can be a gem.

### Readability Score Tools

**Readability** is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. 

It is an essential parameter for the user as well as for SEO.

It is also known that artificial intelligence, and thus the Google crawler, is better at distinguishing short sentences than long ones.

As a result, short sentences are easier to understand for both the reader and the Googlebot. Of course, you have to consider your readers.

There will be no problem for them in writing complex articles on relatively tricky subjects if your readers are experts on your case. 

The content creation software in this section are applications that measure at least which age group can understand your articles. It is called _the readability score_.

There are some popular formulas and metrics calculating the readability score of your text.

However, creating short and concise content can be hard to create. With the tools below, you can make your copy more readable and quickly shorten sentences. Run your written copy through the web app and you'll see the opportunities to make it better for your readers in seconds. 

It should also be noted that most of them are either free or freemium with a generous plan.
